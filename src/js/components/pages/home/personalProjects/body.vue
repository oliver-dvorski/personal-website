                    You've probably used link sharing using Google drive, Onedrive, Dropbox or some other solution. Isn't it absolutely great? But in order to use a system like that you need to <b>log in</b> to one of those services. Well, what if you're trying to transfer files from an untrusted device? That's exactly what I made Zippy for - disposable link sharing.

                <p>
                    Dynamic web qr codes are qr codes that can be "edited" after they've been printed or otherwise published. Pretty nifty, except I couldn't find a generator that offers those for free. Now, the fees for these aren't astronomical but the way that these codes work is just stupidly simple so I've made a generator of my own.
