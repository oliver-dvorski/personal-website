                <p>
                    The app itseslf was a SPA written with Vue. I was assigned as the first front end developer that joined the project.

                <p>
                    I'll soon add a page where I discuss the details of this project but for now I'm waiting for the clients approval of that page. Should only take a few days.

                <h3>Justy24</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea behind Justy24.com was to eliminate waiting periods. Starting with restaurants. Customers would discover nearby restaurants, order a meal, reserve their table and pay through the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Justy24 was built on Laravel with Vue components sprinkled in as needed. Bulma was our CSS framework of choice.
                </p>
