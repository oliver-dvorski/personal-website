                <h3>Justy24</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea behind Justy24.com was to eliminate waiting periods. Starting with restaurants. Customers would discover nearby restaurants, order a meal, reserve their table and pay through the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Justy24 was built on Laravel with Vue components sprinkled in as needed. Bulma was our CSS framework of choice.
